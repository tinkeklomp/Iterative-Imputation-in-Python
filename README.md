Simulation Setup for Master Thesis Project "Iterative Imputation in Python" by Tinke Klomp

The performance of IterativeImputer is assessed through bias, coverage rate and confidence interval width.

The simulation setup includes functions that generate and ampute data. The amputed data is imputed by IterativeImputer.

Functions that impute data with mice and handle data with complete case analysis are included as well, as they are used as benchmark methods to compare 
the performance of IterativeImputer with.
